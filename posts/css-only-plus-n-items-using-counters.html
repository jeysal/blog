        Even if you've been writing CSS frequently for many years, there's a
        good chance you've never heard of
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/counter"
          >counters</a
        >
        before, despite them having been implemented for the better part of the
        century, since IE 8 and Chrome/Firefox 1. If you <em>have</em> heard of
        them before, there's a good chance it was for numbering headings, or
        perhaps for numbering list items in a more complex way than
        <code>list-style-type</code> can.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, we'll look at a more exotic use case for CSS counters that
        I came up with
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://github.com/yldio/asap-hub/commit/a382c6b5a6411e2d987db141b546f83a66ffe276"
          >a while ago in 2020</a
        >. We want to render a list, in this example a list of tags such as
        those often shown as little pills on an article. But in case there are
        too many tags, perhaps hundreds of tags, that would excessively clutter
        the screen, we want to only show the first few — for now the first five
        — tags and then shorten the remaining <var>n</var> tags to
        <samp>+n more tag(s)</samp>.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic rigid JS implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The following <code>renderTagList</code> function is an example
        implementation of this behavior, and its output for an uncropped list
        example and a cropped list example is shown below the code.
      </p>
      <pre><code id="rigid-js-impl" class="language-js" data-stripindent>
        const MAX_ITEMS = 5;
        const renderTagList = (tags) => {
          const items = tags.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS);
          const numberOfCroppedItems = tags.length - items.length;

          const itemElements = items.map((item) =>
            Object.assign(document.createElement("li"), { textContent: item })
          );
          if (numberOfCroppedItems > 0) {
            itemElements.push(
              Object.assign(document.createElement("li"), {
                className: "shortener",
                textContent: `+${numberOfCroppedItems} more tag(s)`,
              })
            );
          }

          const list = Object.assign(document.createElement("ol"), { className: "tag-list" });
          list.append(...itemElements);
          document.currentScript.insertAdjacentElement("beforebegin", list);
        };

        In case you're curious because there's already a lot going on just to
        nicely show all tags on one line: The styles for this are as follows,
        and we'll apply them to all examples on this page:
      </p>
      <pre><code data-applystyle class="language-css" data-stripindent>
        .tag-list {
          margin-block: 16px;

          display: flex;
          gap: 8px;
        }
        .tag-list > li {
          max-inline-size: max-content;
          flex: 1 0;

          white-space: nowrap;
          overflow: hidden;
          text-overflow: ellipsis;

          border: 1px solid currentcolor;
          border-radius: 100vmax;
          padding: 0.5em;
        }
        .tag-list > li.shortener {
          min-inline-size: max-content;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>The screen space problem</h3>
      <p>
        Now, if you are viewing this article in a large window on a large
        screen, the five tags plus shortener tag probably look okay to you. If
        the tag list, however, has little space or a sufficiently large font
        size, each tag will be so narrow that it is cut off after the first
        letter. Letting the flexbox <code>wrap</code> would "solve" this, but we
        probably don't want to sacrifice half a screen of vertical space just to
        display as many tags as we do on large screens where the space is not at
        a premium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we can make our <code>MAX_ITEMS</code> flexible based on how
        much space is available. We can show up to two items on small screens,
        and up to five on big screens starting from some threshold. Short of
        reaching for a <code>ResizeObserver</code> and expensive JS
        re-layouting, there is a straightforward hack we could use to do this
        that almost always works™: Render both versions (<samp
          >5 tags + 3 more tag(s)</samp
        >, and <samp>2 tags + 6 more tag(s)</samp>) and conditionally hide the
        one we don't need with <code>display: none</code> in a media or
        container query.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is always a hack and never ideal. It causes longer script
        execution time and bigger DOM size. With smart use of modern CSS, I have
        yet to see a real-world case where things cannot be layouted properly.
        The case at hand seems daunting, because we need to render the
        <samp>+n more tag(s)</samp> text based on both total number of items and
        the limit of items to show for the current size, all in CSS. Yet if you
        manage to take this challenge and think of an old, rarely used CSS
        feature called counters, the pieces suddenly start falling into place.
      </p>
      <h3>The counter solution</h3>
      <p>
        The solution is to implement a CSS counter that starts at the total
        number of items and counts <em>down</em> by one for each item.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this version, our JavaScript code actually does less. It always
        renders all list items, and always renders a shortener item. Note that
        additionally, using a CSS custom property, it lets the list know the
        total <code>--number-of-items</code>. I believe that unless something
        like
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4559"
          ><code>sibling-{count,index}()</code></a
        >
        is shipped, we cannot figure this out in CSS on its own.
      </p>
      <pre><code id="counter-impl" class="language-js" data-stripindent>
        const renderTagList = (tags) => {
          const itemElements = tags.map((item) =>
            Object.assign(document.createElement("li"), { textContent: item })
          );
          const shortenerElement =
            Object.assign(document.createElement("li"), { className: "shortener" });

          const list =
            Object.assign(document.createElement("ol"), { className: "tag-list shortened" });
          list.style.setProperty("--number-of-items", tags.length);
          list.append(...itemElements, shortenerElement);
          document.currentScript.insertAdjacentElement("beforebegin", list);
        };

        renderTagList(["Web development", "HTML", "CSS", "JS"]);

        renderTagList([
          "Coding 101",
          "Programming",
          "Technology",
          "Web design",

          "HTML",
          "CSS",
          "JS",
        ]);
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Now, have a look at the CSS. Since it is quite dense, some explanations
        may be required, which follow below.
      </p>
      <pre><code data-applystyle class="language-css" data-stripindent>
        .shortened {
          container-type: inline-size;
        }
        .shortened > li:first-of-type {
          counter-reset: remaining-items var(--number-of-items);
        }
        .shortened > li:not(.shortener) {
          counter-increment: remaining-items -1;
        }

        .shortened > li:nth-of-type(n + 6) {
          display: none;
        }
        @container (max-inline-size: 700px) {
          .shortened > li:nth-of-type(n + 3) {
            display: none;
          }
        }

        .shortened > .shortener {
          display: none;
        }
        .shortened > li:nth-of-type(n + 6) ~ .shortener {
          display: unset;
        }
        @container (max-inline-size: 700px) {
          .shortened > li:nth-of-type(n + 3) ~ .shortener {
            display: unset;
          }
        }
        .shortened > .shortener::after {
          content: "+" counter(remaining-items) " more tag(s)"
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        First, we set up the list as a container so that we can query its inline
        size later and adjust the number of items to show based on it. We make
        the first item initialize the <code>remaining-items</code> counter with
        the total <code>--number-of-items</code>, and make each item, including
        the first item, count it down by one, so that it stores the number of
        items remaining unrendered.<br />
        I would like to move the <code>counter-reset</code> to the list itself
        instead of the first item because it would be less clunky, but for some
        reason,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_counter-reset_reset_does_not_affect_siblings"
          >only Firefox</a
        >
        has implemented initializing a counter and then using it in child
        elements at the time of writing this post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we hide every element, including the shortener if applicable,
        starting from the sixth item (the first item that exceeds our limit of
        five). If the list has less than <code>700px</code> of space, we further
        hide every element starting from the third item (the first item that
        exceeds our limit of two). This establishes our cropping if there are
        items with such high indices, but does not yet deal with showing a
        shortener if anything was cropped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, we start by generally hiding the shortener. It might have already
        been cropped by the previous code, but if our list is shorter than our
        limit that has not yet happened. We then show the shortener again if it
        succeeds an item that is cropped, namely the sixth item in a large
        container or the third in a small one. If an item with such a high index
        exists, something is being cropped off and we need to show the
        shortener.
        <br />Finally, we set the shortener text using a
        <code>::after</code> pseudo-element. One might think that the counter
        will always be zero at this point, because we initialize it with the
        total number of items and count it down by one for each item, but there
        is one important part of the CSS Lists and Counters spec that makes the
        number of remaining items actually correct and not always zero. Counter

          >have no effect in elements that do not generate boxes</a
        >, such as those set to <code>display: none</code>. This is why our
        cropped items will leave the <code>remaining-items</code> counter
        untouched.
      </p>
      The final result looks is shown below, for the same two examples of tag
      lists. Make sure to try it out on a small screen where up to two tags are
      shown, and a big screen where up to five tags are shown. Note that at the

      <h3>Final notes</h3>
      <p>
        It is arguably nonsensical to ever show <samp>+1 more tag(s)</samp>,
        because the text is so long that one might as well show the actual one
        remaining tag instead. To address this, we could make the shortener text
        actually short (such as <samp>+n</samp>). Alternatively, it is fairly
        straightforward to add in <code>nth-last-of-type</code> selectors to
        disable the cropping if only one item would be cropped. This was omitted
        here because the CSS code already has enough going on that needs to be
        explained as is.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use counters like in this blog post, watch the progress of
        <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_counter-reset_reversed"
          ><code>reversed()</code> counters</a
        >. They could further simplify things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is pretty amazing that CSS can do this, and not only due to recent
        additions — container queries can be substituted with media queries, the
        core counter shortening implementation remaining intact. However, this
        is still not how I would like the tag list component to work. In an
        ideal world, the number of tags to show is not decided by a map from
        container size ranges to tag limits, but by the length of the tags
        themselves. The shortener should act like
        <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code>, jumping in when there is not
        enough space left to show the next tag.<br />
        We rely on <code>display: none</code> to disable counting down for
        elements that are not actually visible. It is not possible to do this
        relying on elements overflowing their box, because these elements still
        generate boxes and thus count down the counter. Furthermore, there is no
        way to query for elements that overflow their parent, because it would
        mix up cause and effect. The styles are the cause, and the layout,
        including which elements overflow and which don't, is the effect.
        Altering the styles based on an overflow would create a cycle, which CSS
        tries to, and has with a few exceptions managed to, avoid.<br />
